        "solution": "The minimum weighable quantity (MWQ) = sensitivity × 100 / percentage error = 6 mg × 100 / 5 = 120 mg. You must weigh at least 120 mg. Weigh 150 mg drug (≥120 mg), dilute with 450 mg lactose to make 600 mg mixture. The aliquot factor is (50 mg / 150 mg) × 600 mg = 200 mg. The 200‑mg aliquot contains 50 mg of drug.",

          "Weigh 150 mg of drug using the aliquot method and dilute to a total of 600 mg with lactose (450 mg diluent); then take one‑third (200 mg) of the mixture to obtain 50 mg chlorpheniramine."

        "solution": "The MWQ is 40 mg. To weigh 15 mg accurately, weigh 60 mg of capsaicin (≥40 mg), add 100 mg starch (total 160 mg). The fraction 15/60 = 0.25, so take 0.25 × 160 mg = 40 mg mixture as the aliquot containing 15 mg capsaicin.",

          "Weigh at least 40 mg of capsaicin (MWQ = 2 mg×100/5 = 40 mg), dilute with 100 mg starch to a 160‑mg mixture, then take an aliquot of (15/60)×160 = 40 mg to obtain 15 mg capsaicin."

        "solution": "Using ≤2% error: MWQ = 6.5 mg × 100 / 2 = 325 mg. Weigh at least 325 mg of substance—e.g., 400 mg—mix with 8000 mg diluent to 8400 mg. The aliquot fraction is 20/400 = 0.05; multiply by 8400 mg to get 420 mg mixture containing 20 mg drug.",
