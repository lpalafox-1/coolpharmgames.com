Ticagrelor,Brilinta,P2Y12 Antagonist,"Reversibly binds to the P2Y12 ADP receptor on platelets, inhibiting platelet activation and aggregation."
Aspirin,Bayer,Antiplatelet Agent,"Inhibits cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), reducing the formation of thromboxane A2 and inhibiting platelet aggregation."
Isosorbide Mononitrate,Imdur,Nitrate,"Relaxes vascular smooth muscle by increasing nitric oxide, leading to vasodilation."
Valsartan/sacubitril,Entresto,ARB & Neprilysin Inhibitor,"Selectively blocks binding of angiotensin II to AT1 receptor, preventing vasoconstriction and reducing aldosterone secretion; inhibits neprilysin to induce vasodilation and natriuresis."
